    """
    A simple implementation of selection sort.

    In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity,
    which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Wikipedia

    Worst complexity: n^2
    Average complexity: n^2
    Best complexity: n^2
    Space complexity: 1
    Method: Selection
    Stable: No
    Class: Comparison sort
